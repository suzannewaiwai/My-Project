# SageMaker Deployment Project

Machine Learning Deployment using AWS SageMaker

General Outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.

1) Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
2) Process / Prepare the data.
3) Upload the processed data to S3.
4) Train a chosen model.
5) Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
6) Deploy the trained model.
7) Use the deployed model.

Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.

Using PyTorch instead of XGBoost and SageMaker
